This project was created to assist backend developers using Node.js and Express in saving time by quickly configuring their projects and setting up basic code for an Express project. The project includes several features such as:

1. Authentication with session.
2. Storing sessions in a Redis database.
3. Storing users in a MongoDB database.
4. Using Nginx to manage load balancing between Docker Express instances.
